Welcome onboard everyone. Wishing u all a great learning experience. 

How to get started? Here are some pointers. 
N.B. Whenever u have any suggestions/modifications or better alternatives to these pointers, please share them with us. 
These pointers won't work for everyone. I need your feedback and suggestions so that we can together create a starting guide that is as conclusive and useful as possible. 

First thing: We need to set up our local machines. 

For Linux/Mac users, getting started is much easier. 

For windows users, I highly recommend windows subsystem for linux (WSL)

This hopefully would make ur life much easier throughout the course and even after it. 

The transition to WSL is fairly easy through this link.
[WSL for windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/web-frameworks)
You will keep on using windows on ur laptops while having an additional way to run linux commands through the terminal.

The transition has saved me hours and hours. 

If you wish to use windows, which again I don't recommend, upgrade to windows 10 and check the links below.
